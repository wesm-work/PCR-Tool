# PCR-Tool
The tool has a couple functions. The first function will reach to a remote host and grab all mapped network drives. The second function will then take those drives and map them to a new computer. The last function will reach out to a remote host an grab a list of installed applications and compare it to a new computer and result in a list of apps that need to be installed.
